PRELIMINARY INFO:

## Definition of "Accession" from NCBI, from sample record (URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sitemap/samplerecord.html#AccessionB): 

>The unique identifier for a sequence record. An accession number applies to the complete record and is usually a combination of a letter(s) and numbers, such as a single letter followed by five digits (e.g., U12345) or two letters followed by six digits (e.g., AF123456). Some accessions might be longer, depending on the type of sequence record.

>Accession numbers do not change, even if information in the record is changed at the author's request. Sometimes, however, an original accession number might become secondary to a newer accession number, if the authors make a new submission that combines previous sequences, or if for some reason a new submission supercedes an earlier record.

>Records from the RefSeq database of reference sequences have a different accession number format that begins with two letters followed by an underscore bar and six or more digits, for example:

>NT_123456   constructed genomic contigs
>NM_123456   mRNAs
>NP_123456   proteins
>NC_123456   chromosomes
>Note: compare accession number with Sequence Identifiers such as Version and GI for nucleotide sequences and protein_id and GI for amino acid sequences.

>Entrez Search Field: Accession [ACCN] 
>Search Tip: The letters in the accession number can be written in upper- or lowercase. RefSeq accessions must contain an underscore bar between the letters and the numbers, e.g., NM_002111.

# GETTING STARTED

## Dependencies

- poppler
- pdfgrep version 2.0 

### Install dependencies for mac OSX:

### Steps

1. Install/check homebrew. Check to see if you have homebrew (```$ brew --version```) and make sure it is up to date (```$ brew update```). If necessary, download and install homebrew (e.g. using pip, curl)
2. Run ```$ brew doctor```, and follow instructions to correct any absent or broken symlinks.
* Link by doing ```$ brew link <package_name>```
3. Install poppler dependencies using homebrew...
```$ brew install cairo fontconfig freetype glib gobject-introspection libgcrypt libpng libunistring little-cms2 openjpeg pkg-config qt5 xz```
(Note: before installing poppler I also did ```$ brew install doxygen libunistring```, because even though these two packages are not required they are recommended by the poppler documentation)
4. Install poppler...
```$ brew install poppler```
5. Install pdfgrep 2.0 (https://pdfgrep.org/)
```
$ curl https://pdfgrep.org/download/pdfgrep-2.0.tar.gz		## You can also git clone the latest development version from github.
$ ## Next, unzip the tarball:
$ xvf XXXXXXXXXX
$ ## Then configure and install pdfgrep:
$ cd pdfgrep-2.0
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

# GOALS / PLANNING THE DATA MINING STEPS

1. Start from folder with PDF files of phylogeography / popgen / phylogenetic
manuscripts of interest.

2. Enter the working directory and extract lines matching potential/putative GenBank 
accession numbers to a '.txt' file (one per PDF), whose name contains part or all of the 
original PDF file name (e.g. "Baumsteiger_et_al_2016_IDnos.txt" for a paper 
with filename "Baumsteiger_et_al_2016_Cottus_asper_Cottidae_California_JH.pdf")

3. The lines in the output .txt file could contain single GenBank numbers or ranges, in
regular text or table (or other) format, but they also might contain other numbers (e.g.
grant numbers). So, next we want to check and edit the output files so that they only
contain accession numbers. The ultimate goal is for each .txt file to consist of only one
GenBank accession number per line, for example:

DQ324115 
DQ324116
DQ324117
DQ324118
DQ324119

4. Once we have achieved GenBank accession number lists for each paper, we need to move 
them into individual sub-folders. So, we create a sub-folder with the full or partial name 
of the paper/PDF file and move the final accession number .txt file into that sub-folder.

5. Now we have a working directory containing all of the PDF files, plus one sub-folder per 
PDF with name corresponding to that PDF, inside of which there is a .txt file containing 
the accession numbers from the PDF. So, we need to go to GenBank and download the coding
sequence (CDS) and GenBank data for each accession. We will use a Python script named
"fetch_accession.py" to do this. Specifically, since we have this script in our PATH (and
thus available from the command line), we will loop through the sub-folders and execute 
the Python script inside each sub-folder.

6. After "fetching" the accessions, each sub-folder will contain one ".gb" file containing
information about the accession record, and one ".fasta" file containing the corresponding
sequence. This is not a usable format for the data, although it is well-structured. In order
to make the data useful, we will concatenate the fasta sequences in each sub-folder into
a single file containing the full or partial name of the original manuscript PDF.

7. The next step is to process the fasta sequences so that sequences for different species,
or matching a particular identifier, are split into separate files (without destroying the
original file of concatenated fasta sequences).

# STEPS AND CODE SNIPPETS/NOTES (more detailed)

##### 1. Start from folder with PDF files of phylogeography / popgen / phylogenetic
##--manuscripts of interest. These are collated by hand during a literature search and 
##--have already been screened for appropriate focus, taxon, question, sampling, & scale.


##### 2. For each PDF file (with extension .pdf), use pdfgrep to extract all lines with
##--GenBank accession numbers, which are always formatted as two uppercase letters followed 
##--by at least 6 (but sometimes also 7) Arabic numbers. We can combine find and pdfgrep
##--to do this, in practice, by finding all files with extension .pdf in the current 
##--directory and then conducting the pdfgrep search and outputing results to file using
##--a redirect command, as follows:

find . -iname '*.pdf' -exec pdfgrep "[A-Z]{2,}[0-9]{6,}" {} + > accession_nos.txt

##--For each instance of a putative accession number matching the grep search above, 
##--pdfgrep outputs a line of the format: "./<PDFname.pdf>:<matching_line_content>", and 
##--typically multiple lines will be output for each file that contains matches. Invariably,
##--some of the lines might contain technical numbers or grant numbers, and these are not
##--the desired target. Other lines may include numbers other than GenBank numbers, such
##--as years of publication references, or other numeric information.
#
##--For example, this is an excerpt of the first 12 lines of the .txt file from a 
##--preliminary analysis: 

##--./Ahti_et_al_2016_Coris_wrasses_phylogeography_mtDNA_COI_GH_RPS7_marine_Indian_Pacific_Ocean_JBI.pdf:Bank accession no. KF929780), the closest known relative to    22 alleles (Fig. 3b). Pairwise /ST comparisons for GnRH

##--Five lines contain individual GenBank accession numbers, in this case "GI" numbers. 
##--Other lines, for example line 3, contain ranges of GenBank accession numbers with the 
##--format "<start_number>-<end_number>" or "<start_number> - <end_number>". However, four 
##--lines, including lines 2, 9, 11, and 12 contain grant numbers (e.g. "FT130101068 to LB 
##--Beheregaray") and we want to avoid those. We want to separate out accession numbers, 
##--single or in ranges, into one file for each paper.


##### 3. Move all lines corresponding to each manuscript to a new '.txt' file and place that 
##--file into a folder. The new text file and folder should carry the same or a similar name 
##--relative to that of the original manuscript. We also should move the corresponding 
##--manuscript, or a copy of it, into the newly created folder. We can use a for loop...
